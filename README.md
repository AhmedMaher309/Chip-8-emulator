# Chip-8 Emulator

## Overview
This repository contains a Chip8 emulator, a program that simulates the behavior of a Chip8 virtual machine. The Chip8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the mid-1970s for early microcomputers. It was designed to simplify the development of games and applications for these systems.

## Features
- The emulator accurately emulates the Chip8 virtual machine, including its CPU instructions, memory layout, and display rendering.
- It supports loading and executing Chip8 ROMs, which are programs written for the Chip8 platform.
- The emulator provides a graphical display of the Chip8 screen and allows user input via a keyboard.
